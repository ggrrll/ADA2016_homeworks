# ADA - Homework 03

## Instructions

This homework is divided in **two notebooks** :
* `1-Data-Wrangling.ipynb` is dedicated to the data fetching and wrangling
* `2-Map-Viz.ipynb` contains the map viz creation

To visualize the maps, you can either :
* **go to https://maximepeschard.keybase.pub/adahw03/**
* download the HTML versions in the [`maps`](maps/) folder

Finally, another file `helpers.py` contains some functions used to handle data.
